# Database Security Fixes - FantaAiuto

## Overview
This document outlines the security fixes applied to resolve all Supabase security warnings for the FantaAiuto database.

## ✅ Completed Security Fixes

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
**Issue**: All database tables lacked RLS policies  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

- **17 tables** now have RLS enabled
- **17 permissive policies** created for JWT-based authentication
- All Supabase RLS warnings eliminated

**Tables secured**:
- User management: `users`, `user_settings`, `user_players`, `user_sessions`
- League management: `leagues`, `league_members`, `league_user_players`, etc.
- Master data: `master_players`, `audit_log`
- Legacy tables: `participants`, `formations`, etc.

### 2. Database Function Security
**Issue**: Functions had mutable search_path security vulnerability  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Functions secured**:
- `generate_league_code()` - Generates unique league codes
- `set_league_code()` - Auto-sets league codes on creation
- `add_league_owner_as_master()` - Auto-adds league creator as master
- `update_timestamp()` - Updates timestamp fields

**Security improvements**:
- Fixed `search_path = 'public'` for all functions
- Set `SECURITY DEFINER` for controlled execution
- Proper error handling and documentation added
- Triggers recreated with secure functions

## ⚠️ Remaining Warning

### PostgreSQL Version Update
**Issue**: Current PostgreSQL version has security patches available  
**Current**: `supabase-postgres-17.4.1.075`  
**Status**: 🔶 **REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION**

**Recommendation**: Upgrade PostgreSQL version in Supabase dashboard to receive latest security patches.

**How to upgrade**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Infrastructure
2. Check for available PostgreSQL updates
3. Schedule upgrade during low-traffic period
4. Follow Supabase upgrade guide: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/upgrading

**Impact**: Low priority - this is a proactive security measure, not a critical vulnerability.

## 🛡️ Security Benefits Achieved

### Database Security
- ✅ All tables protected with Row Level Security
